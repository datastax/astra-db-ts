/**
 * ##### Overview
 *
 * Options controlling the blocking behavior of certain admin operations.
 *
 * Some admin operations require repeatedly polling the database's status to check if said operation is complete.
 * These operations may be long- or short-running, but they are not instantaneous.
 *
 * By default, these operations **block** until completion, with a method-defined polling interval that can be overridden.
 *
 * Alternatively, you can opt for **non-blocking** behavior, in which case the operation returns immediately, leaving it up to the caller to manually determine completion.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ##### Blocking
 *
 * When `blocking` is `true` (default), the operation will **not return** until it is *fully complete*.
 * Completion is determined by polling the database's status at a regular interval.
 *
 * You can customize the polling interval using the `pollInterval` option (in milliseconds).
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Will block by default until the operation is complete.
 * const dbAdmin1 = await admin.createDatabase({ ... });
 *
 * // Blocks with a custom poll interval (e.g. every 5 seconds).
 * const dbAdmin2 = await admin.createDatabase({ ... }, {
 *   pollInterval: 5000,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ##### Non-blocking
 *
 * When `blocking` is `false`, the operation returns immediately after initiating the request.
 * It becomes your responsibility to check when the operation has completed.
 *
 * **Important:** In this mode, *resources will still not be usable until the operation finishes.*
 *
 * For instance:
 * - `createDatabase` returns an `AstraDbAdmin` object, but it wonâ€™t point to an active database until creation is complete.
 * - `createKeyspace` won't actually allow you to use that keyspace until the database is back to active.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Will return immediately without waiting for operation completion
 * //
 * // The AstraDbAdmin object is still returned, but it's not very useful
 * // until the operation completes.
 * const dbAdmin3 = await admin.createDatabase({...}, {
 *   blocking: false,
 * });
 * ```
