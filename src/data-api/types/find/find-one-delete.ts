 * @field sort - The sort order to pick which document to delete if the filter selects multiple documents.
 * @field projection - Specifies which fields should be included/excluded in the returned documents.
 * @field includeResultMetadata - When true, returns alongside the document, an `ok` field with a value of 1 if the command executed successfully.

   * projection will, of course, affect the shape of the returned documents. It may be a good idea to cast

   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * interface User {
   *   name: string;
   *   age: number;
   * }
   *
   * const collection = db.collection<User>('users');
   *
   * const doc = await collection.findOne({}, {
   *   projection: {
   *     _id: 0,
   *     name: 1,
   *   },
   *   vector: [.12, .52, .32],
   *   includeSimilarity: true,
   * }) as { name: string, $similarity: number };
   *
   * // Ok
   * console.log(doc.name);
   * console.log(doc.$similarity);
   *
   * // Causes type error
   * console.log(doc._id);
   * console.log(doc.age);
