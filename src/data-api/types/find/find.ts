   * interface User {

   *   age: number;
   * }
   *
   * const collection = db.collection<User>('users');

   *     name: 1,
   *   },
   *   vector: [.12, .52, .32],
   *   includeSimilarity: true,
   * }) as { name: string, $similarity: number };

   * // Ok
   * console.log(doc.name);
   * console.log(doc.$similarity);
