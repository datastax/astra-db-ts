   * }
   *
   * const collection = db.collection<User>('users');

   *     _id: 0,
   *     name: 1,
   *   },
   *   vector: [.12, .52, .32],
   *   includeSimilarity: true,
   * }) as { name: string, $similarity: number };
   *
   * // Ok
   * console.log(doc.name);
   * console.log(doc.$similarity);

   * // Causes type error

   * console.log(doc.age);
