 * |----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | `idle`         | The cursor is uninitialized/not in use, and may be modified freely.                |
 * | `started`      | The cursor is currently in use, and cannot be modified w/out rewinding or cloning. |
 * | `closed`       | The cursor is closed, and cannot be used w/out rewinding or cloning.               |
 *

 *
 * ##### State Transitions
 *
 * - **idle ‚Üí started:** Occurs when `next()`, `hasNext()`, iteration, or any other method that fetches data is called.
 * - **started ‚Üí closed:** Occurs when iteration completes, an error is thrown during iteration, or `close()` is explicitly called.
 * - **\* ‚Üí idle:** Occurs when `rewind()` is called on any cursor.
 *
 * @public

 *

 *
 * In full, the cursor is typed as `AbstractCursor<T, TRaw>`, where
 * - `T` is the type of the mapped records, and
 * - `TRaw` is the type of the raw records before any mapping.
 *
 * If no mapping function is provided, `T` and `TRaw` will be the same type. Mapping is done using the {@link AbstractCursor.map} method.
 *
 * `TRaw` is currently only publicly exposed in `consumeBuffer()`.
