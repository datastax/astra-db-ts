/**
 * ##### Overview
 *
 * Represents the interface to a collection in a Data-API-enabled database.
 *
 * > **‚ö†Ô∏èWarning:** This isn't directly instantiated, but spawned via {@link Db.createCollection} or {@link Db.collection}.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const collection = db.collection<Type?>('my_collection');
 * ```
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ##### Typing the collection
 *
 * Collections are inherently untyped, but you can provide your own client-side compile-time schema for type inference and early-bug-catching purposes.
 *
 * > **üö®Important:** For most intents & purposes, you can ignore the (generally negligible) difference between _WSchema_ and _RSchema_, and treat {@link Collection} as if it were typed as `Collection<Schema>`.
 *
 * A `Collection` is typed as `Collection<WSchema, RSchema>`, where:
 * - `WSchema` is the type of the row as it's written to the table (the "write" schema)
 *    - This includes inserts, filters, sorts, etc.
 *  - `RSchema` is the type of the row as it's read from the table (the "read" schema)
 *    - This includes finds
 *    - Unless custom ser/des is used, it is nearly exactly the same as `WSchema`
 *    - This defaults to `FoundDoc<WSchema>` (see {@link FoundDoc})
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ##### Typing the `_id`
 *
 * The `_id` field of the document may be any valid JSON scalar (including {@link Date}, {@link UUID}, and {@link ObjectId}).
 * - See {@link SomeId} for the enumeration of all valid types.
 * - See {@link CollectionDefaultIdOptions} for more info on setting default `_id`s.
 *
 * The type of the `_id` field is extracted from the collection schema via the {@link IdOf} utility type.
 *
 * > **üí°Tip:** See {@link SomeId} for much more information on the `_id` field.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * interface User {
 *   _id: UUID,
 *   name: string,
 * }
 *
 * const coll = await db.createCollection<User>('users', {
 *   defaultId: { type: 'uuid' },
 * });
 *
 * const resp = await coll.insertOne({ name: 'Alice' });
 * console.log(resp.insertedId.version) // 4
 * ```
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ##### Datatypes
 *
 * Certain datatypes may be represented as TypeScript classes (some native, some provided by `astra-db-ts`), however.
 *
 * For example:
 * - `$date` is represented by a native JS {@link Date}
 * - `$uuid` is represented by an `astra-db-ts` provided {@link UUID}
 * - `$vector` is represented by an `astra-db-ts` provided {@link DataAPIVector}
 *
 * You may also provide your own datatypes by providing some custom serialization logic as well (see later section).
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * interface User {
 *   _id: string,
 *   dob: Date,
 *   friends?: Record<string, UUID>, // UUID is also `astra-db-ts` provided
 *   $vector: DataAPIVector,
 * }
 *
 * await db.collection<User>('users').insertOne({
 *   _id: '123',
 *   dob: new Date(),
 *   $vector: new DataAPIVector([1, 2, 3]), // This can also be passed as a number[]
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The full list of relevant datatypes (for collections) includes: {@link UUID}, {@link ObjectId}, {@link Date}, {@link DataAPIVector} and {@link BigNumber}.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ##### Big numbers
 *
 * By default, big numbers (`bigint`s and {@link BigNumber}s from `bignumber.js`) are disabled, and will error when attempted to be serialized, and will lose precision when deserialized.
 *
 * See {@link CollectionSerDesConfig.enableBigNumbers} for more information on enabling big numbers in collections.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ##### Custom datatypes
 *
 * You can plug in your own custom datatypes, as well as enable many other features by providing some custom serialization/deserialization logic through the `serdes` option in {@link CollectionOptions}, {@link DbOptions}, and/or {@link DataAPIClientOptions.dbOptions}.
 *
 * Note however that this is currently not entirely stable, and should be used with caution.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ##### üö®Disclaimers
 *
 * *Collections are inherently untyped. There is no runtime type validation or enforcement of the schema.*
 *
 * *It is on the user to ensure that the TS type of the `Collection` corresponds with the actual intended collection schema, in its TS-deserialized form. Incorrect or dynamic tying could lead to surprising behaviors and easily-preventable errors.*

   *

   *
   * @example

   *
   * // Insert a document with a specific ID

   * await collection.insertOne({ _id: 1, name: 'Jane Doe', $vectorize: "Hey there!" });
   * ```
   *
   * ---
   *
   * ##### The `_id` field
   *
   * If the document does not contain an `_id` field, the server will **generate an _id** for the document.
   * - The type of the generated id may be specified in {@link CollectionDefinition.defaultId} at collection creation, otherwise it'll just be a raw UUID string.
   * - This generation does not mutate the document.
   *
   * If an `_id` is provided which corresponds to a document that already exists in the collection, a {@link DataAPIResponseError} is raised, and the insertion fails.
   *
   * If you prefer to upsert a document instead, see {@link Collection.replaceOne}.
   *
   * > **üí°Tip:** See {@link SomeId} for much more information on the `_id` field.
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * // Insert a document with an autogenerated ID
   * await collection.insertOne({ name: 'Jane Doe' });
   *
   * // Use the inserted ID (generated or not)
   * const resp = await collection.insertOne({ name: 'Lemmy' });
   * console.log(resp.insertedId);
   *
   * // Or if the collection has a default ID
   * const collection = db.createCollection('users', {
   *   defaultId: { type: 'uuid' },
   * });
   *
   * const resp = await collection.insertOne({ name: 'Lemmy' });
   * console.log(resp.insertedId.version); // 4
   * ```
   *
   * @param document - The document to insert.
   * @param options - The options for this operation.
   *
   * @returns The ID of the inserted document.
   *
   * @see CollectionInsertOneOptions
   * @see CollectionInsertOneResult
   */
  public async insertOne(document: MaybeId<WSchema>, options?: CollectionInsertOneOptions): Promise<CollectionInsertOneResult<RSchema>> {
    return this.#commands.insertOne(document, options);
  }

  /**
   * ##### Overview
   *
   * Inserts many documents into the collection.
   *
   * See {@link CollectionInsertManyOptions} and {@link CollectionInsertManyResult} as well for more information.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * import { uuid } from '@datastax/astra-db-ts';
   *
   * await collection.insertMany([
   *   { _id: uuid.v4(), name: 'John Doe' }, // or UUID.v4()
   *   { name: 'Jane Doe' },
   * ]);
   * ```
   *
   * ---
   *
   * ##### Chunking
   *
   * > **üö®Important:** This function inserts documents in chunks to avoid exceeding insertion limits, which means it may make multiple requests to the server. As a result, this operation is **not necessarily atomic.**
   * >
   * > If the dataset is large or the operation is ordered, it may take a relatively significant amount of time. During this time, documents inserted by other concurrent processes may be written to the database, potentially causing duplicate id conflicts. In such cases, it's not guaranteed which write will succeed.
   *
   * By default, it inserts documents in chunks of 50 at a time. You can fine-tune the parameter through the `chunkSize` option. Note that increasing chunk size won't always increase performance. Instead, increasing concurrency may help.
   *
   * You can set the `concurrency` option to control how many network requests are made in parallel on unordered insertions. Defaults to `8`.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * const docs = Array.from({ length: 100 }, (_, i) => ({ _id: i }));
   * await collection.insertMany(docs, { concurrency: 16 });
   * ```
   *
   * ---
   *
   * ##### Ordered insertion
   *
   * You may set the `ordered` option to `true` to stop the operation after the first error; otherwise documents may be parallelized and processed in arbitrary order, improving, perhaps vastly, performance.
   *
   * Setting the `ordered` operation disables any parallelization so insertions truly are stopped after the very first error.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * // Will throw an InsertManyError after the 2nd doc is inserted with a duplicate key;
   * // the 3rd doc will never attempt to be inserted
   * await collection.insertMany([
   *   { _id: '1', name: 'John Doe' },
   *   { _id: '1', name: 'John Doe' },
   *   { _id: '2', name: 'Jane Doe' },
   * ], {
   *   ordered: true,
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * ---
   *
   * ##### The `_id` field
   *
   * If the document does not contain an `_id` field, the server will **generate an _id** for the document.
   * - The type of the generated id may be specified in {@link CollectionDefinition.defaultId} at collection creation, otherwise it'll just be a raw UUID string.
   * - This generation does not mutate the document.
   *
   * If an `_id` is provided which corresponds to a document that already exists in the collection, a {@link DataAPIResponseError} is raised, and the insertion fails.
   *
   * > **üí°Tip:** See {@link SomeId} for much more information on the `_id` field.
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * // Insert documents with autogenerated IDs
   * await collection.insertMany([
   *   { name: 'John Doe' },
   *   { name: 'Jane Doe' },
   * ]);
   *
   * // Use the inserted IDs (generated or not)
   * const resp = await collection.insertMany([
   *   { name: 'Lemmy' },
   *   { name: 'Kilmister' },
   * ]);
   * console.log(resp.insertedIds); // will be string UUIDs
   *
   * // Or if the collection has a default ID
   * const collection = db.createCollection('users', {
   *   defaultId: { type: 'objectId' },
   * });
   *
   * const resp = await collection.insertMany([
   *   { name: 'Lynyrd' },
   *   { name: 'Skynyrd' },
   * ]);
   * console.log(resp.insertedIds[0].getTimestamp()); // will be ObjectIds
   * ```
   *
   * ---
   *
   * ##### `CollectionInsertManyError`
   *
   * If any 2XX insertion error occurs, the operation will throw an {@link CollectionInsertManyError} containing the partial result.
   *
   * If a thrown exception is not due to an insertion error, e.g. a `5xx` error or network error, the operation will throw the underlying error.
   *
   * In case of an unordered request, if the error was a simple insertion error, the {@link CollectionInsertManyError} will be thrown after every document has been attempted to be inserted. If it was a `5xx` or similar, the error will be thrown immediately.
   *
   * @param documents - The documents to insert.
   * @param options - The options for this operation.
   *
   * @returns The IDs of the inserted documents (and the count)
   *
   * @throws CollectionInsertManyError - If the operation fails.
   *
   * @see CollectionInsertManyOptions
   * @see CollectionInsertManyResult
   */

   * ---
   *
   * ##### Update by vector search
   *
   * If the collection has vector search enabled, you can update the most relevant document by providing a vector in the sort option.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts

   *
   * ##### Pagination
   *
   * > **üö®Important:** This function paginates the updating of documents due to server update limits, which means it may make multiple requests to the server. As a result, this operation is **not necessarily atomic**.

   *
   * ##### Upserting
   *
   * If `upsert` is set to true, it will insert the document reconstructed from the filter & the update filter if no match is found.
   *
   * Only one document may be upserted per command.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * const resp = await collection.updateMany(

   *
   * ##### Delete by vector search
   *
   * If the collection has vector search enabled, you can delete the most relevant document by providing a vector in the sort option.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * await collection.insertOne({ name: 'John Doe', $vector: [.12, .52, .32] });
   * await collection.deleteOne({}, { sort: { $vector: [.11, .53, .31] }});
   * ```
   *
   * @param filter - A filter to select the document to delete.
   * @param options - The options for this operation.
   *
   * @returns How many documents were deleted.
   *
   * @see CollectionFilter
   * @see CollectionDeleteOneOptions
   * @see CollectionDeleteOneResult
   */

  /**
   * ##### Overview
   *
   * Deletes many documents from the collection.
   *
   * See {@link CollectionFilter}, {@link CollectionDeleteManyOptions}, and {@link CollectionDeleteManyResult} as well for more information.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * await collection.insertMany([
   *   { name: 'John Doe', age: 1 },
   *   { name: 'John Doe', age: 2 },
   * ]);
   * await collection.deleteMany({ name: 'John Doe' });
   * ```
   *
   * ---
   *
   * ##### Pagination
   *
   * > **üö®Important:** This function paginates the deletion of documents due to server deletion limits, which means it may make multiple requests to the server. As a result, this operation is **not necessarily atomic**.
   * >
   * > Depending on the amount of matching documents, it can keep running (in a blocking manner) for a macroscopic amount of time. During this time, documents that are modified/inserted from another concurrent process/application may be modified/inserted during the execution of this method call.
   *
   * ---
   *
   * ##### üö®Filtering
   *
   * The filter can contain a variety of operators & combinators to select the document. See {@link CollectionFilter} for much more information.
   *
   * > **üö®Important:** If an empty filter is passed, **all documents in the collection will atomically be deleted in a single API call**. Proceed with caution.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * await collection.insertMany([
   *   { name: 'John Doe' },
   *   { name: 'Jane Doe' },
   * ]);
   *
   * const resp = await collection.deleteMany({});
   * console.log(resp.deletedCount); // -1
   * ```
   *
   * @param filter - A filter to select the documents to delete.
   * @param options - The options for this operation.
   *
   * @returns How many documents were deleted.
   *
   * @see CollectionFilter
   * @see CollectionDeleteManyOptions
   * @see CollectionDeleteManyResult
   */
  public async deleteMany(filter: CollectionFilter<WSchema>, options?: CollectionDeleteManyOptions): Promise<CollectionDeleteManyResult> {
    return this.#commands.deleteMany(filter, options, (e, result) => new CollectionDeleteManyError(e, result));
  }

  /**
   * ##### Overview
   *
   * Find documents in the collection, optionally matching the provided filter.
   *
   * See {@link CollectionFilter}, {@link CollectionFindOptions}, and {@link FindCursor} as well for more information.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * const cursor = await collection.find({ name: 'John Doe' }, { sort: { age: 1 } });
   * const docs = await cursor.toArray();
   * ```
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * const cursor = await collection.find({})
   *   .sort({ age: 1 })
   *   .project<{ name: string }>({ name: 1 })
   *   .map(doc => doc.name);
   *
   * // ['John Doe', 'Jane Doe', ...]
   * const names = await cursor.toArray();
   * ```
   *
   * ---
   *
   * ##### Projection
   *
   * > **üö®Important:** When projecting, it is _heavily_ recommended to provide an explicit type override representing the projected schema, to prevent any type-mismatches when the schema is strictly provided.
   * >
   * > Otherwise, the documents will be typed as the full `Schema`, which may lead to runtime errors when trying to access properties that are not present in the projected documents.
   *
   * > **üí°Tip:** Use the {@link Pick} or {@link Omit} utility types to create a type representing the projected schema.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * interface User {
   *   name: string,
   *   car: { make: string, model: string },
   * }
   *
   * const collection = db.collection<User>('users');
   *
   * // --- Not providing a type override ---
   *
   * const cursor = await collection.find({}, {
   *   projection: { car: 1 },
   * });
   *
   * const next = await cursor.next();
   * console.log(next.car.make); // OK
   * console.log(next.name); // Uh oh! Runtime error, since tsc doesn't complain
   *
   * // --- Explicitly providing the projection type ---
   *
   * const cursor = await collection.find<Pick<User, 'car'>>({}, {
   *   projection: { car: 1 },
   * });
   *
   * const next = await cursor.next();
   * console.log(next.car.make); // OK
   * console.log(next.name); // Type error; won't compile
   * ```
   *
   * ---
   *
   * ##### Filtering
   *
   * The filter can contain a variety of operators & combinators to select the documents. See {@link CollectionFilter} for much more information.
   *
   * > **‚ö†Ô∏èWarning:** If the filter is empty, all documents in the collection will be returned (up to any provided or server limit).
   *
   * ---
   *
   * ##### Find by vector search
   *
   * If the collection has vector search enabled, you can find the most relevant documents by providing a vector in the sort option.
   *
   * Vector ANN searches cannot return more than a set number of documents, which, at the time of writing, is 1000 items.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * await collection.insertMany([
   *   { name: 'John Doe', $vector: [.12, .52, .32] },
   *   { name: 'Jane Doe', $vector: [.32, .52, .12] },
   *   { name: 'Dane Joe', $vector: [.52, .32, .12] },
   * ]);
   *
   * const cursor = collection.find({}, {
   *   sort: { $vector: [.12, .52, .32] },
   * });
   *
   * // Returns 'John Doe'
   * console.log(await cursor.next());
   * ```
   *
   * ---
   *
   * ##### Sorting
   *
   * The sort option can be used to sort the documents returned by the cursor. See {@link Sort} for more information.
   *
   * If the sort option is not provided, there is no guarantee as to the order of the documents returned.
   *
   * > **üö®Important:** When providing a non-vector sort, the Data API will return a smaller number of documents (20, at the time of writing), and stop there. The returned documents are the top results across the whole collection according to the requested criterion.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * await collection.insertMany([
   *   { name: 'John Doe', age: 1, height: 168 },
   *   { name: 'John Doe', age: 2, height: 42 },
   * ]);
   *
   * const cursor = collection.find({}, {
   *   sort: { age: 1, height: -1 },
   * });
   *
   * // Returns 'John Doe' (age 2, height 42), 'John Doe' (age 1, height 168)
   * console.log(await cursor.toArray());
   * ```
   *
   * ---
   *
   * ##### Other options
   *
   * Other available options include `skip`, `limit`, `includeSimilarity`, and `includeSortVector`. See {@link CollectionFindOptions} and {@link FindCursor} for more information.
   *
   * If you prefer, you may also set these options using a fluent interface on the {@link FindCursor} itself.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * // cursor :: FindCursor<string>
   * const cursor = collection.find({})
   *   .sort({ $vector: [.12, .52, .32] })
   *   .projection<{ name: string, age: number }>({ name: 1, age: 1 })
   *   .includeSimilarity(true)
   *   .map(doc => `${doc.name} (${doc.age})`);
   * ```
   *
   * @remarks
   * When not specifying sorting criteria at all (by vector or otherwise),
   * the cursor can scroll through an arbitrary number of documents as
   * the Data API and the client periodically exchange new chunks of documents.
   *
   * --
   *
   * It should be noted that the behavior of the cursor in the case documents
   * have been added/removed after the `find` was started depends on database
   * internals, and it is not guaranteed, nor excluded, that such "real-time"
   * changes in the data would be picked up by the cursor.
   *
   * @param filter - A filter to select the documents to find. If not provided, all documents will be returned.
   * @param options - The options for this operation.
   *
   * @returns a FindCursor which can be iterated over.

   * console.log(doc.name); // Type error; won't compile
   * ```
   *
   * ---
   *
   * ##### Filtering
   *
   * The filter can contain a variety of operators & combinators to select the document. See {@link CollectionFilter} for much more information.
   *
   * > **‚ö†Ô∏èWarning:** If the filter is empty, and no {@link Sort} is present, it's undefined as to which document is selected.
   *
   * ##### Find by vector search
   *
   * If the collection has vector search enabled, you can find the most relevant document by providing a vector in the sort option.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * await collection.insertMany([
   *   { name: 'John Doe', $vector: [.12, .52, .32] },
   *   { name: 'Jane Doe', $vector: [.32, .52, .12] },
   *   { name: 'Dane Joe', $vector: [.52, .32, .12] },
   * ]);
   *
   * const doc = collection.findOne({}, {
   *   sort: { $vector: [.12, .52, .32] },
   * });
   *
   * // 'John Doe'
   * console.log(doc.name);
   * ```
   *
   * ##### Sorting
   *
   * The sort option can be used to pick the most relevant document. See {@link Sort} for more information.
   *
   * If the sort option is not provided, there is no guarantee as to which of the documents which matches the filter is returned.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * await collection.insertMany([
   *   { name: 'John Doe', age: 1, height: 168 },
   *   { name: 'John Doe', age: 2, height: 42 },
   * ]);
   *
   * const doc = collection.findOne({}, {
   *   sort: { age: 1, height: -1 },
   * });
   *
   * // 'John Doe' (age 2, height 42)
   * console.log(doc.name);
   * ```
   *
   * ##### Other options
   *
   * Other available options include `includeSimilarity`. See {@link CollectionFindOneOptions} for more information.
   *
   * If you want to get `skip` or `includeSortVector` as well, use {@link Collection.find} with a `limit: 1` instead.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * const doc = await cursor.findOne({}, {
   *   sort: { $vector: [.12, .52, .32] },
   *   includeSimilarity: true,
   * });

   * ```
   *
   * ---
   *
   * ##### Major disclaimer üö®
   *
   * > **üö®Important:** This is a **client-side operation**.
   * >
   * > This method browses all matching documents (albeit with a projection) using the logic of the {@link Collection.find} method, and collects the unique value for the given `key` manually.
   * >
   * > As such, there may be performance, latency, and ultimately billing implications if the amount of matching documents is large.
   * >
   * > Therefore, it is **heavily recommended** to only use this method on **small datasets**, or a **strict filter**.
   *
   * ---
   *
   * ##### Usage
   *
   * The key may use dot-notation to access nested fields, such as `'field'`, `'field.subfield'`, `'field.3'`, `'field.3.subfield'`, etc. If lists are encountered and no numeric index is specified, all items in the list are pulled.
   *
   * > **‚úèÔ∏èNote:** On complex extractions, the return type may be not as expected.** In that case, it's on the user to cast the return type to the correct one.
   *
   * Distinct works with arbitrary objects as well, by stable-y stringifying the object and comparing it with the string representations of the objects already seen.
   * - This, unsurprisingly, may not be great for performance if you have a lot of records that match, so it's **recommended to use distinct on simple values** whenever performance or number of records is a concern.
   *
   * For details on the behavior of "distinct" in conjunction with real-time changes in the collection contents, see the remarks on the `find` command.
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * await collection.insertMany([
   *   { letter: { value: 'a' }, car: [1] },
   *   { letter: { value: 'b' }, car: [2, 3] },
   *   { letter: { value: 'a' }, car: [2], bus: 'no' },
   * ]);
   *
   * // ['a', 'b']
   * const distinct = await collection.distinct('letter.value');
   *
   * await collection.insertOne({
   *   x: [{ y: 'Y', 0: 'ZERO' }],
   * });
   *
   * // ['Y']
   * await collection.distinct('x.y');
   *
   * // [{ y: 'Y', 0: 'ZERO' }]
   * await collection.distinct('x.0');
   *
   * // ['Y']
   * await collection.distinct('x.0.y');
   *
   * // ['ZERO']
   * await collection.distinct('x.0.0');
   * ```
   *

   * ```
   *
   * ---
   *
   * ##### The `limit` parameter üö®
   *
   * > **üö®Important:** This operation takes in a `limit` option which dictates the maximum number of documents that may be present before a {@link TooManyDocumentsToCountError} is thrown.
   * >
   * > If the limit is higher than the highest limit accepted by the Data API (i.e. `1000`), a {@link TooManyDocumentsToCountError} will be thrown anyway.

   * const count = await collection.countDocuments({}, 1);
   * ```
   *
   * @remarks
   * Count operations are expensive: for this reason, the best practice is to provide a reasonable `upperBound`
   * according to the caller expectations. Moreover, indiscriminate usage of count operations for sizeable amounts
   * of documents (i.e. in the thousands and more) is discouraged in favor of alternative application-specific
   * solutions. Keep in mind that the Data API has a hard upper limit on the amount of documents it will count,

   * ---
   *
   * ##### `returnDocument`
   *
   * `returnDocument` (default `'before'`) controls whether the original or the updated document is returned.
   * - `'before'`: Returns the document as it was before the update, or `null` if the document was upserted.
   * - `'after'`: Returns the document as it is after the update.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * await collection.insertOne({ _id: '1', name: 'John Doe' });
   *
   * const after = await collection.findOneAndReplace(
   *   { _id: '1' },
   *   { name: 'Jane Doe' },

   *

   * ##### Find one and replace by vector search
   *
   * If the collection has vector search enabled, you can replace the most relevant document by providing a vector in the sort option.
   *
   * See {@link Collection.replaceOne} for a concrete example.

   *
   * ##### Projection
   *
   * > **üö®Important:** When projecting, it is _heavily_ recommended to provide an explicit type override representing the projected schema, to prevent any type-mismatches when the schema is strictly provided.
   * >
   * > Otherwise, the returned document will be typed as the full `Schema`, which may lead to runtime errors when trying to access properties that are not present in the projected document.
   *
   * > **üí°Tip:** Use the {@link Pick} or {@link Omit} utility types to create a type representing the projected schema.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * await collection.insertOne({ _id: '1', name: 'John Doe', age: 3 });
   *
   * const doc = await collection.findOneAndDelete<{ name: string }>(
   *   { _id: '1' },
   *   { projection: { name: 1, _id: 0 } },

   * ---
   *
   * ##### Upserting
   *
   * If `upsert` is set to true, it will insert the document reconstructed from the filter & the update filter if no match is found.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * const resp = await collection.findOneAndUpdate(

   *
   * ---
   *
   * ##### `returnDocument`
   *
   * `returnDocument` (default `'before'`) controls whether the original or the updated document is returned.
   * - `'before'`: Returns the document as it was before the update, or `null` if the document was upserted.
   * - `'after'`: Returns the document as it is after the update.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * await collection.insertOne({ _id: '1', name: 'John Doe' });
   *
   * const after = await collection.findOneAndUpdate(
   *   { _id: '1' },
   *   { $set: { name: 'Jane Doe' } },
   *   { returnDocument: 'after' },
   * );
   *
   * // Prints { _id: '1', name: 'Jane Doe' }

   *
   * @param filter - A filter to select the document to find.
