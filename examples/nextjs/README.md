# astra-db-ts w/ Next.js

## Overview

`astra-db-ts` works nearly natively with Next.js, depending on the runtime used:
- `edge`: `astra-db-ts` will work like normal here.
- `nodejs`:`astra-db-ts` will work like normal hereâ€”the `DataAPIClient` may just need a hint to
  use `fetch` instead of the default http client under the hood, as such:
  ```ts
  const client = new DataAPIClient('*TOKEN*', {
    httpOptions: { client: 'fetch' },
  });
  ```

This is a simple example of how it can be used to interact with an Astra database; it'll simply 
list out all the collections in a given database.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites:

- Make sure you have an existing Astra Database running @ [astra.datastax.com](https://astra.datastax.com/).
    - You'll need an API key and a database endpoint URL to get started.

### How to use this example:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required values.

4. Run `npm run dev` to start the local development server.

5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the example in action.

### Steps to start your own project:

1. Use the typical `npx create-next-app@latest` to create a new Next.js project.

2. Install `@datastax/astra-db-ts` by running `npm i @datastax/astra-db-ts`.

3. If you're using the (default) `nodejs` runtime, be sure to set `httpOptions.client` to `'fetch'`
   in the `DataAPIClient`

4. You should be able to use `@datastax/astra-db-ts` in your project as normal now.
